    use MarpaX::Languages::C::AST::Scope;

    my $cAstScopeObject = MarpaX::Languages::C::AST::Scope->new();
    $cAstScopeObject->parseEnterScope();
    $cAstScopeObject->parseReenterScope();
    $cAstScopeObject->parseEnterTypedef("myTypedef");
    $cAstScopeObject->parseEnterEnum("myEnum");
    $cAstScopeObject->parseObscureTypedef("myVariable");
    foreach (qw/myTypedef myEnum myVariable/) {
      if (parseIsTypedef($_)) {
        print "\"$_\" is a typedef\n";
      } elsif (parseIsEnum($_)) {
        print "\"$_\" is an enum\n";
