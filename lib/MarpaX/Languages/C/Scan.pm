# VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This modules returns a grammar dependant C::Scan-like interface. Current grammars are:

=over

=item ISO-ANSI-C-2011

The ISO grammar of ANSI C 2011, as of L<http://www.quut.com/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y-2011.html> and L<http://www.quut.com/c/ANSI-C-grammar-l.html>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MarpaX::Languages::C::Scan;
    my $cSourceCode = <<C_SOURCE_CODE;

    typedef int myInt_type;
    typedef enum myEnum1_e {X11 = 0, X12} myEnumType1_t, *myEnumType1p_t;
    typedef enum {X21 = 0, X22} myEnumType2_t, *myEnumType2p_t;
    typedef struct myStruct1 {int x;} myStructType1_t, *myStructType1p_t;
    typedef struct {int x;} myStructType2_t, *myStructType2p_t;

    C_SOURCE_CODE
    my $scan = MarpaX::Languages::C::Scan->new(content => $cSourceCode);

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new($class, grammarName => $grammarName, %options)

Instance a new object. Takes a hash as argument. The entire %options content is forwarded to a per-grammar C::Scan-like implement. Supported grammars are:

=over

=item ISO-ANSI-C-2011

ISO ANSI C 2011, with GNU and MSVS extensions. This is the default value.

=back

Please refer to per-grammar documentation for other options and methods.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, %options) = @_;

  my $grammarName = $options{grammarName} || 'ISO-ANSI-C-2011';

  if (! defined($grammarName)) {
    croak 'Usage: new($grammar_Name)';
  } elsif ($grammarName eq 'ISO-ANSI-C-2011') {
    return MarpaX::Languages::C::AST::Grammar::ISO_ANSI_C_2011::Scan->new(%options);
  } else {
    croak "Unsupported grammar name $grammarName";
  }
}

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 replace($self, $from, $to, $declaration, %options)

In the asDOM mode only, this function is replacing $from by $to in any structure that matches $declaration. For example: with a $declaration value "f(int *x)", if $from is "x" and $to is "x[3]", it is as if the declaration would become "f(int *x[3])".

Only the global structure in terms of children has to be matched. This mean that the example above would have worked as well with a $declaration value of "f(int z, float *x)". Embedded declarations obey the same rule, for instance to match a structure member you only have to write its parents e.g.: "struct y {int x;}", even if in reality "struct y" contains something before "x".

Internally, this method will call again MarpaX::Languages::C::Scan->new(%options) on $declaration, please refer to the new() method for %options description.

=cut

sub replace {
  my ($self, $from, $to, $declaration, %options) = @_;

  $log->tracef('Making as AST of %s', $declaration);

  my $c = MarpaX::Languages::C::Scan->new(content => $declaration, %options);

}
